## Notes

Hi! This is a hobby project of mine, the PySorter. I'm a newbie self-taught programmer who loves to code bread. Feel free to re-use or change the code to your liking. If you have any comments, issues, or suggestions, feel free to reach out. You can contact me via Gmail: jangkayld@gmail.com or Twitter: @Benf_105.

## What is PySorter

PySorter is a simple python file sorter CLI app I made to clean, fix, and organize my files.I Sometimes download or transfer lots and lots of and sometimes forget organizing them, so yeah why not let Python do the job.

## How it Works

1. First, choose a directory where you want files to be sorted.
2. Scan the files in that directory and store the types of files present.
3. Create a folder named "PySorter" to store the files.
4. Create subfolders for each identified file extension, such as .docx and .pdf.
5. Move the files to their respective folders accordingly.
