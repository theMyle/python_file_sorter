## Notes ##

Hi! This is a hobby project of mine, the PySorter. I'm a newbie self-taught programmer addicted to cocaine.

## What is PySorter ##

PySorter is a simple simple CLI app that sorts your file.

## How it Works ##

1. First, choose a directory where you want files to be sorted.
2. Scans the files in that directory.
4. Create subfolders for each identified file extension, such as .docx and .pdf.
5. Moves the files to their respective folders.

## Un_sorter finally implemented! ##

1. Scans your PySort directory and sub directory.  
2. Moves the files inside the base directory of the folder selected.  

### Enjoy! ###
